PyJadx
======

PyJadx provides Python binding for `Jadx decompiler <https://github.com/skylot/jadx>`_.

As Jadx is written in Java, it use the JNI interface through `jni.hpp <https://github.com/mapbox/jni.hpp>`_ to make the bridge Java / C++ then it uses `pybind11 <https://github.com/pybind/pybind11>`_
to create the bridge C++ / Python.
