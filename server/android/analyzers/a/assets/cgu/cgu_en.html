        <br/><br/>You, the User, can unreservedly accept these GTCU through a process designed to ensure the integrity of your consent. You will first be invited to read these GTCU in full. You may then confirm that you have read and accept them by clicking the &quot;I have read and I accept the GTCU&quot; box, as a result of which all of the provisions of the GTCU will be binding upon You from that time.
        <br/><br/>The GTCU, together with any appendices and special terms and conditions, as applicable, constitute contractual documents by which You will be bound. They form the contract between You as the User and Perspecteev, from the time You accept them (hereinafter, the ‘Contract’).
        <br/>If any of the clauses of these documents should be declared null, invalid or without effect, for any reason whatsoever, the other clauses will remain in full force and effect, except in the case the nullity of one or more essential clauses of the GTCU and / or the interdependence of the contractual stipulations would likely result in the cancellation of all or part of the GTCU
        <br/><br/>Immediately after conclusion of the Contract, You will receive an email confirming the creation of your User Account. The email will contain a link so that You can read the GTCU and download them on a durable medium (in PDF format).
        <br/><br/>Your Identification Data must remain strictly personal and confidential. You are solely responsible for the use of your Identification Data.
        <br/><br/><h3 class="dbl fs12 mt1">4.2. Logging in to and out of your User Account‍</h3>
        You must use your Identification Data to log in to the Website or Application. You may, however, create a Security Code that You can use to log in to your User Account and use the Transfer Feature (see below).
        <br/><br/>Instead of the Security Code, You may select one of the other methods proposed in your User Account (such as fingerprint or face recognition, if the device on which You are using the Application is compatible with such a method).

        <br/>‍<br/>‍<strong>Logging in‍</strong><br/><br/>Whenever You use your Authentication Data to log in to your User Account, all the information associated with the corresponding payment Accounts and Other Assets will automatically be synchronized.
        <br/><br/>You will then be able to select in the Application or Website settings the payment Accounts and Other Assets for which You wish consolidated information to be displayed in your User Account.
        <br/><br/>The information associated with the Accounts and Other Assets is automatically updated several times each day, and whenever You request, without the input of your Authentication Data. Authentication Data is encrypted and stored securely by Perspecteev.
        <br/><br/>‍<strong>Updating Authentication Data</strong>
        <br/>‍<br/>‍You must update your Authentication Data in your User Account whenever it changes. If You fail to do this, Perspecteev will no longer be able to update the information that can be accessed via said Authentication Data.

        <br/><strong>Retention of Personal Data‍</strong>
        <br/><br/>User’s Personal Data is not retained beyond the necessary period of time for these purposes. According to the anti-money laundering and terrorism financing obligations, it may be retained for up to five (5) years upon termination of the contractual relation between the User and Perspecteev (pursuant to article L. 561-12 of the French Monetary and Financial Code). Once the retention period elapsed, Perspecteev destroys the User’s Personal Data.
        <br/><br/><strong>Storage and transfer outside the European Union</strong>
        <br/>‍<br/>‍All Collected Personal Data is stored on our servers within the European Union.
        <br/>It is susceptible to be transferred outside the European Union. In this case, Perspecteev makes the necessary arrangements with its subcontractors and partners to guarantee an adequate level of protection of the User’s Personal Data, in accordance with the regulation in force (Chapter V of the GDPR).
        <br/>If the concerned subcontractors or partners are not located in a country with a legislation considered to provide an adequate level of protection or do not stick to the Privacy Shield agreement (with regard to Personal Data transfers to the United States), they must have signed beforehand the “standard data protection clause” (validated by the European Commission or a supervisory authority) or be subject to “binding corporate rules” (validated by the European Commission or a supervisory authority).
        <br/>If the subcontractors or partners do not fulfill any of these conditions (country with adequate level of protection, Privacy Shield, standard data protection clause or binding corporate rules), Perspecteev undertakes not to transfer any User’s Personal Data to the concerned subcontractor or partner.
        <br/><br/><h3 class="dbl fs12 mt1">15.3. Confidentiality of Personal Data disclosed to Perspecteev</h3>
        Perspecteev attaches the utmost importance to the confidentiality of Personal Data.

        <br/><br/><h3 class="dbl fs12 mt1">15.4. Right of access, opposition, rectification, portability, deletion and limitation of Personal Data </h3>
        Please be advised that according to article 13 of GDPR, You have a right of access, rectification, portability and deletion of your Personal Data, to object to the processing of such Personal Data and to determine what should become of it after your death (articles 15 et seq. of the GDPR).

        <br/>The User also has the possibility to file a complaint with the French data protection agency (Commision Nationale Informatique et Libertés) according to article 77 of the GDPR.
        <br/><br/>For security reasons, Perspecteev reserves the right to request other supporting documents if it has any concerns about the value and authenticity of the proof You provide.<br/><br/>If case You object to the processing of your Personal Data, You may be invited to close your User Account (in case of the impossibility for Perspecteev to provide the concerned Services without the treatment in question).

        The Services have been designed to best meet the needs of Users, and Perspecteev is firmly committed to offering the Services in a fully transparent manner and in compliance with the applicable legislation.<br/><br/>In view thereof, and in compliance with article L. 34-5 of the French Code of Postal and Electronic Communications (Code des postes et communications électroniques) and the provisions of the above-mentioned French Data Protection Act, You acknowledge and accept that, from the time You start using the Services, Perspecteev may, based on the Data it processes, offer You business referrals by means of links that can be accessed via the Services or documents sent to You directly, in order to allow You to take advantage of service offerings similar to those covered by the GTCU.<br/><br/>In this regard, You may receive advertisements concerning offers for products or services, including in particular banking or financial products or services, within the meaning of Article L. 341-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, to the extent permitted by law.<br/><br/>You are also informed that You can opt out of allowing your Personal Data to be used for marketing at any time by sending an email to the following address: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:support@bankin.com">support@bankin.com</a>.
        <br/><br/>If You object to the processing of your Personal Data, and as said recommendations form an integral part of the Perspecteev Services, You may be invited to close your User Account (in case of the impossibility for Perspecteev to provide the concerned Services without the treatment in question).
        <br/><br/><h3 class="dbl fs12 mt1">15.6. Your opening of an account with a “Coach” partner of Perspecteev, directly from the Bankin’ Application: Perspecteev intermediation activities</h3>
        In order to offer You the best support in your personal finance management, Perspecteev has chosen trusted “Coach” partners to provide You with personalised offers.
        <br/><br/>These partnerships have been entered into in compliance with applicable regulations, taking particular care to provide You with transparent information.
        <br/><br/>You may receive a personalised message presenting the “Coach” partner(s) and offers of services corresponding to your situation.
        <br/><br/>If You are interested in one of these offers or one of these Coach partners, You have the possibility to open an account with this Coach partner. You may open the account directly from the Bankin' Application.
        <br/><br/>In this context, to present offers and Coach partners to You Perspecteev relies on the information originating from the Accounts and Other Assets synchronised by You in the Bankin 'Application. You are therefore aware that this targeting can be carried out on an incomplete basis (for example if You do not synchronise all your Accounts and Other Assets or synchronises Accounts and Other Assets not belonging to You but for which You are entitled to access information).
        <br/><br/>As part of these partnerships, the Coach partner is data controller and Perspecteev is data processor. Perspecteev collects the Data (including Personal Data) according to the instructions of the Coach partner.
        <br/><br/>The sole purpose of this treatment is the opening of an account with the Coach partner. The terms according to which the Personal Data is processed by the Coach partner are more specifically detailed in the agreement binding You and the Partner Coach.
        <h2 class="dbl fs14 mt3">16. Professional Secrecy‍</h2>
        <br/>In accordance with Article L. 522-19 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, Perspecteev is bound by an obligation of professional secrecy.
        <br/><br/>However, it follows from legal provisions that this professional secrecy can not be opposed to certain authorities such as the Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (French banking and insurance regulator), the Banque de France, the tax or customs administration, as well as the judicial authorities acting in the context of criminal proceedings.
        <br/><br/>Similarly, professional secrecy does not prevent Perspecteev from providing information to third parties for the purposes of certain transactions referred to in Article L. 522-19 of the French Monetary and Financial Code and in particular to third parties with whom Perspecteev has entered into service agreements with a view to entrusting them with important operational functions.
        <br/><br/>Persons receiving information subject to professional secrecy must keep it confidential unless the above-mentioned legal derogations can be applied.
        <br/><br/>Finally, You have the option of relieving Perspecteev of its obligation of professional secrecy by expressly authorising it and on a case-by-case basis to communicate information covered by the secret to designated third parties.
        <h2 class="dbl fs14 mt3">17. Anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing</h2>
        <br/>In accordance with Article L. 561-2 et seq. of the French Monetary and Financial Code on the participation of payment institutions in efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, Perspecteev has a duty to carry out due diligence checks concerning your use of the Payment Initiation Service.
        <br/><br/>You acknowledge that Perspecteev may be required to set up surveillance systems to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
        <br/><br/>You acknowledge that Perspecteev may cancel or postpone initiation of a payment transaction at any time, in the absence of sufficient evidence concerning its purpose or nature. You are informed that the initiation of a payment transaction in accordance with these GTCU may be reported to the national financial intelligence unit.
        <br/><br/>In accordance with the regulations, You may access all Personal Data disclosed, provided this right to access Data does not jeopardize efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, when the Personal Data concerns You and is held within the framework of Article L. 561-2 et seq. of the French Monetary and Financial Code.
        <br/><br/>No action can be based on Articles 226-13 and 226-14 of the French Criminal Code (Code pénal), no civil liability action can be brought against, and no disciplinary sanctions can be imposed on, Perspecteev, its officers or employees or any other person referred to in Article L. 561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code who have submitted the reports referred to in Article L. 561- 22 of the same Code in good faith.
        <h2 class="dbl fs14 mt3">18. Duty of advice in the Perspecteev intermediation activities‍</h2>
        <br/>The Service allowing You to open an account with one of its Coach partners directly from the Bankin' Application is a Perspecteev intermediation activity.
        <br/><br/>When offering this service, although Perspecteev is exempted from obtaining the status of intermediary in banking and payment services pursuant to article L. 519-1 II of the French Monetary and Financial Code, Perspecteev wishes to comply with this regulation.
        <br/><br/>In this context, to present a specific Coach partner to You Perspecteev relies on the information originating from the Accounts and Other Assets synchronised by You in the Bankin' Application.
        <br/><br/>You are therefore aware that this targeting can be carried out on an incomplete basis (for example if You do not synchronise all your Accounts and Other Assets or synchronises Accounts and Other assets not belonging to You but for which You are entitled to access information).
        <br/><br/>You then undertake to indicate all the elements in your possession to complete your profile, so as to receive advice best suited to your situation.
        <br/><br/>In complying with these regulations Perspecteev has a duty of advice toward You, so that You receive advice tailored to your needs, requirements, and levels of knowledge of the operations at stake.
        <br/><br/>This duty of advice is solely based on the information and Data transmitted by You while subscribing to a Coach partner’s offer made directly from the Bankin' Application.
        <br/><br/>It is at this very moment that You determine your requirements, your needs, and express your level of knowledge on the subscribed product.
        <br/><br/>Perspecteev sends You a summary of these elements on a durable medium
        <h2 class="dbl fs14 mt3">19. Intellectual Property</h2>
